Compile/run:
     - Compile using
            make 
     - run executable with
            ./hw4

Program Purpose:
The program initalizes a Binary Search Tree that tracks how many instances
of each number it has.

Testing: 
I started by just trying to run the hw4.cpp file, and I had issues with the
insert function as I had forgot to actually set the root to what was returned.
I also had issues with find_min/max function, as originally it searched for the
node without using a while loop and did not work. Once hw4 was working, I made
a test file and used that to check my functions. My test file checks each of
the potential cases of removals, with zero, one, and two children respectivily,
as well as deleting the root. It also checks copying and assignment and the 
contains function.

1. Remove uses find_min in order to move the approrpite child up the tree
to take the space of the removed node
2. Yes
3a. It could return null because if it is called on a child of a node
which has no children, it will return the node that was passed into it,
which, in this case, would be nullptr.
4. look left, if null, return the current space, if  not,
go to the left child
5. look right, if null, return the current space, if  not, 
go to the right child
6. go left of a node, go right, go to the root, and delete each
of nodes you encounter, then stop and return if a node is null
